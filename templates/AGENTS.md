## Mission

Use the installed OpenCode workflows to onboard repositories and deliver minimal, reviewed, and documented changes.

## Workflow

1. Use `planner` for orchestration, questions, workflow selection, planning, handoffs, and git-based review.
2. Use `/plan` for staged delivery when work needs onboarding, planning, architecture or safety review, multiple phases, or has meaningful regression risk.
3. Use `research` for repository onboarding before planning changes in unfamiliar repos.
4. For staged delivery, use one `code` child session per approved phase; `code` stops after each atomic stage and waits for manual validation.
5. For quick delivery, `planner` may invoke `quickcode` for one approved low-risk task; `quickcode` works without staged pauses and reports once for planner review.
6. Escalate quick delivery back to staged delivery if scope, risk, validation, or acceptance criteria become unclear.
7. Use `test` when completed changes need critical testing review or regression coverage.
8. Update durable memory under `docs/ai/` only for onboarding findings, approved plans, decisions, architecture changes, and short logs.

## Progressive Disclosure

- Read this file and the repository `README.md` first.
- Read `docs/ai/README.md` before loading other AI memory.
- Load only task-relevant plans, ADRs, architecture notes, or logs.
- Run onboarding before implementation planning if `docs/ai/` memory is missing or stale.
- Pass compact handoff briefs with paths and reasons to load references.
- Do not paste full docs, diffs, logs, or chat transcripts into handoffs.

## Repository Boundary

- Treat the installed target repository root as the default boundary for searches, reads, edits, and commands.
- Do not operate outside that root unless the user explicitly approves the external path.
- Include `Repository root:` in handoffs so child agents inherit the boundary.
- Require explicit user approval before reviewing cross-repository or external paths.

## Engineering Rules

- Prefer the smallest correct change.
- Preserve unrelated user changes in the worktree.
- Avoid speculative abstractions and broad refactors.
- Update documentation when behavior, configuration, or workflows change.
- Do not commit unless the user explicitly asks.

## Validation Rules

- Start with checks closest to the changed code.
- For staged delivery, propose manual validation commands after each atomic stage.
- For quick delivery, report validation run and any validation still recommended in the single completion report.
- Report exactly what was run and what was not run.
- Treat missing validation as a review risk.

## Definition Of Done

- The approved phase acceptance criteria are satisfied.
- Staged-delivery manual checkpoints were offered between atomic stages, or quick-delivery results received planner review.
- Relevant tests or testing rationale were reviewed.
- Documentation and durable AI memory are updated when needed.
- The final handoff includes changed files, validation, risks, and a proposed commit message.
